## ðŸ¤– Concept

1spaceX is a web app that helps you to find all the information about SpaceX components. You can find information about the capsules, cores, launches, payloads and rockets.

**1spaceX** UI is built with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. Also with [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/), a TailwindCSS UI Kit.

It is responsive and mobile-first, so you can use it in any device.
